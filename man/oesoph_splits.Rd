\description{
We split oesophageal cancer into its two main histological types: Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) and Adenocarcinoma (AC).
We apportion overall oesophageal cancer prevalence between AC and SCC using data on percentage prevalence by age and sex.
CRUK requested data direct from the UK cancer registries on the number of oesophageal SCCs.
That data isn’t routinely available because it’s morphology (cell type) data, whereas what's published as standard is topography (body part).
Alternatively we could distinguish SCC using the body sites 'upper third of oesophagus' and 'middle third of oesophagus' (ICD-10 codes C15.3 and C15.4)
as a fairly good proxy for SCC (Coupland 2012). These percentages are for 2014 for England.
We therefore need to be aware that in modelling periods that are substantially earlier or later, the percentages might not hold true.
Specifically, AC incidence in males has risen over time while AC incidence in females, and SCC incidence in both sexes, has remained fairly stable –
so the relative proportions of AC and SCC in males have varied over time. We should also consider whether
it's sensible to assume the distribution of AC and SCC in oesophageal cancer will be the same for deaths as it is for cases.
Coupland et al show that 1yr and 5yr overall survival is significantly lower in SCC (1yr 30.3\%, 5yr 8.3\%) than in AC (5yr 36.4%, 5yr 9.4%) –
though the absolute differences are quite small. So arguably there would be a slightly higher ratio of SCC:AC in deaths than in cases.
Arnold et al also provide splits of Oesophageal cancer by subtype for Northern and Western Europe (this might be the approach used in the GBD).
