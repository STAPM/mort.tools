# Process Mortality Microdata <img src="tools/mort.tools_hex.png" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;background-color:white;" width="100" height="100" />
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)  


**WORKING VERSION** - Some code and documentation is still incomplete are undergoing review by the analyst team.   

## Motivation
The motivation for `mort.tools` was to develop a set of functions to clean and do basic processing of the data. The advantage of this is that it ensures we apply a consistent approach across years of data and across the different projects for which we use the data.      

`mort.tools` was created as part of a programme of work on the health economics of tobacco and alcohol at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield. This programme is based around the construction of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM), which aims to use comparable methodologies to evaluate the impacts of tobacco and alcohol policies, and investigate the consequences of clustering and interactions between tobacco and alcohol consumption behaviours.   

## Usage
We have written a range of short [articles](https://stapm.gitlab.io/r-packages/mort.tools/articles/index.html) that explain our data and methods. There is a [reference list of functions](https://stapm.gitlab.io/r-packages/mort.tools/reference/index.html) in this package. Data processing is done on the University of Sheffield managed secure `heta-study` virtual machine.     

The suite of functions within `mort.tools` reads the data for each year, produces cause-specific life tables (focusing on the diseases related to tobacco and alcohol), and gives options for conducting forecasts of cause-specific death rates.     

The **inputs** are the counts of death and mid-year population size.   

The **processes** applied by the functions in `mort.tools` give options to:

1. Read each year of data.  
1. Group the data by the causes related to tobacco and alcohol.  
1. Construct cause-specific life tables.  
1. Forecast trends in cause-specific mortality.    

The **output** of these processes are the trends in cause-specific death rates and population sizes. These dataset can be saved so that you don't need to run the cleaning processes in `mort.tools` each time you want to use the cleaned data.    

## Installation
The `mort.tools` package is currently available only to members of the project team (but contact Duncan Gillespie duncan.gillespie@sheffield.ac.uk to discuss). To access the package you need to [sign-up for a GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/). You will then need to be added to the STAPM project team to gain access.      

Once that is sorted, you can install either the latest version or a specified version from GitLab with:     

```{r gh_installation, message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("getPass")

devtools::install_git(
  "https://gitlab.com/stapm/r-packages/mort.tools.git", 
  credentials = git2r::cred_user_pass("uname", getPass::getPass()),
  ref = "x.x.x",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)

# Where uname is your Gitlab user name.
# ref = "x.x.x" is the version to install - remove this to install the latest version
# this should make a box pop up where you enter your GitLab password
```

Then load the package, and some other packages that are useful. Note that the code within `mort.tools` uses the `data.table::data.table()` syntax.  

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
# Load the package
library(mort.tools)

# Other useful packages
library(dplyr) # for data manipulation and summary
library(magrittr) # for pipes
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
```
